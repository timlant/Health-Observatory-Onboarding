```
Views are virtual tables that can be mapped in QGIS just like regular tables. Views for 2019 American Community Survey demographic data (acs_2019_snap_w_geography), and for SNAP and races demography (snap_demography_races) currently exist in Census database, Public schema, Views:

```{r view, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("view.JPG")
```

The steps for using views in QGIS are the following: 

**1.** (Connect to Cisco AnyConnect before proceeding) In QGIS, click on **Database** to open **DB Manager**.

**2.** In DB Manager window, click **PostGIS**, **postgis.rc.asu.edu**:

```{r view1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("view1.JPG")
```


**3.** In **Enter Credentials** window, enter your login and password, hit **OK**:

```{r view2, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("view2.JPG")
```

**4.** Click on **public** dropdown, all Views will be listed as layers among other available objects:

```{r view3, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("view3.JPG")
```

**5.** Right click on the view layer you need and click on **Add to Canvas**. Close DB Manager window.
**6.** The table is mapped and is ready to be symbolized!

```{r view4, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("view4.JPG")
```
