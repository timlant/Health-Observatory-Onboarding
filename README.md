# Health-Observatory-Onboarding
This directory contains instructions for working with each of the software applications that we make use of in this project, complete with some instructions on how to set them up on a local computer and/or in an online service.  

Roughly in order that you will want to use them:  

- R
- AnyConnect
- qGis
- Connecting to a postgres/postgis database
- qGIS basemaps

Files are organized in this directory for each application.  Go through the .md files to get up to speed with each application.
